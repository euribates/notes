## Sobre swagger

Current version: 3.02

## Definitions

**Path Templating**: refers to the usage of curly braces ({}) to mark a section
of a URL path as replaceable using path parameters.

## Format

An OpenAPI document that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification is itself a JSON
object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.  For example, if
a field has an array value, the JSON array representation will be used:

```json
{
    "field": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
}
```

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats,
YAML version 1.2 is RECOMMENDED along with some additional constraints:

- Tags **must be limited to those allowed by the JSON Schema** ruleset.

- Keys used in YAML maps **must be limited to a scalar string**, as defined by
  the YAML Failsafe schema ruleset.
