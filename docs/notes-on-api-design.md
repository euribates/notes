## Invariantes

Some invariantes we must be confident we will find in all the API
answers:

- All responses consists in one dictionary

- All responses includes one key `timestamp` whit the date and time
  of the response (Useful for traceability and debugging) as determined
  by the server, in UTC. As JSON don't have a format for dates neither
  datetimes, I suggest to use a string in ISO 8601. Like:
  `2018-11-03T14:30:07Z`

- All responses includes one key `status`

    - If status is equal to 'ok', then:
        
        - The key `result` is also include in the dictionary

        - This is the real response of the API and can be any 
        type of json-serializable object

    - If status is equal to 'error', then:

        - The key `result` **IS NOT** included in the dictionary

        - The key `message` is included in the dictionary. It contains
        a string with a plain english description of the problem.
