## Notes on Google Cloud Build

Cloud Build is a service that **executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform
infrastructure**. Cloud Build can import source code from Google Cloud Storage,
Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, execute a build to your
specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers.

Cloud Build executes your build as a series of build steps, where each **build
step is run in a Docker container**. A build step can do anything that can be
done from a container irrespective of the environment. To perform your tasks,
you can either use the supported build steps provided by Cloud Build or wite
your own build steps.


## Managing VMs in GCP

Over the last few videos we learned how to create and use virtual machines
running on GCP. We then explored how we can use one VM as a template for
creating many more VMs with the same setup. You can find a lot more information
about this in the following tutorials:

- <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux>
- <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-vm-from-instance-template>
- <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs>
