Quotes by Neil Gaiman to Help You Write Your Novel
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Rule one, you have to write. If you don’t write, nothing will
    happen.

2.  Know safely what the rules are, and then break them with joy.

3.  Whenever I did something where the only reason for doing it was
    money, normally something would go terribly wrong. And I normally
    wouldn’t get the money and then I wouldn’t have anything. Whereas,
    whenever I did anything where what prompted my doing it was being
    interested, being excited, caring, thinking this is going to be fun,
    even if things went wrong and I didn’t get the money, I had
    something I was proud of.

4.  Everything is driven by characters wanting different things, and by
    those different things colliding. Every moment that one character
    wants something, and another character wants something mutually
    exclusive, and they collide — every time that happens, you have a
    story. If you get stuck, ask yourself what your characters want —
    and that is like a flashlight. It shines a light on the road ahead
    and lets you move forward. It’s the only question that opens the
    door to ‘What do you do next?’

5.  I think that the joy of world building in fiction is honestly the
    joy of getting to play God. Because as an author, you get to build
    the world.

6.  You learn more from finishing a failure than you do from writing a
    success.

7.  I learned to write by writing. I tended to do anything as long as it
    felt like an adventure, and to stop when it felt like work, which
    meant that life did not feel like work.

8.  ‘**And then what happened?**’ Those words, I think, are the most
    important words there are for a storyteller. Anything you can do to
    keep people turning the pages is legitimate.”

9.  **Dialogue is character**. The way that somebody talks, what they
    say, how they say it is character. And dialogue has to show
    character. It also has to show plot. And maybe it can be funny along
    the way.

10. You always have to remember, when people tell you that something
    doesn’t work for them, that they’re right. It doesn’t work for them.
    And that is incredibly important information. You also have to
    remember that when people tell you what they think is wrong and how
    you should fix it, that they’re almost always wrong.
