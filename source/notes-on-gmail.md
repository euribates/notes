## How to send messages using gmail

Using imap:

```
    Send email from: Your gmail address
    Hostname: imap.gmail.com
    Port: 465
    Username: Your gmail address
    Password: Your app password
    Encryption: SSL

Google's Gmail SMTP server is a free SMTP service which anyone who has a Gmail account can use to send emails. You can use it with personal emails, or even with your website if you are sending emails for things such as contact forms, newsletter blasts, or notifications.

To use Gmail's SMTP server, you will need the following settings for your outgoing emails:

```
    Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server: smtp.gmail.com
    Use Authentication: Yes
    Use Secure Connection: Yes (TLS or SSL depending on your mail client/website SMTP plugin)
    Username: your Gmail account (e.g. user@gmail.com)
    Password: your Gmail password
    Port: 465 (SSL required) or 587 (TLS required)
```
