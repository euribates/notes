## Notes on HTTPS and webfaction

## Webfaction

A website’s HTTPS setting is either on or off. Connections to the website are over the specified
protocol only.

If you want your site to be served over HTTPS exclusively, then create a redirect from HTTP to
HTTPS.

If you need your site to be available over both HTTP and HTTPS, then create two website records, one
HTTP and the other HTTPS, and ensure that both sites are assigned to the same IP address.


An HTTPS website requires an SSL/TLS certificate. By default, HTTPS websites will use WebFaction’s
shared certificate. Alternately, you can use our control panel to generate a free certificate using
Let’s Encrypt or even bring your own, issued by another SSL certificate issuer.

If you use WebFaction’s shared certificate, **most browsers will warn that your domain doesn’t match
the certificate** (though the connection will still be encrypted). To set up your website to use
HTTPS with WebFaction’s certificate, see Use a Certificate with a Website.

If you want to automatically provision a a free SSL certificate, using Let’s Encrypt as your
Certificate Authority, you can select that option when you add or edit an HTTPS enabled website, see
Use a Certificate with a Website. Our panel will renew such a certificate when it is near its
expiration date.
