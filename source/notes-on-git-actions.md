## Introducción a GitHub Actions

You can write individual tasks, called **actions**, and combine them to create a
custom workflow.  Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up
in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project
on GitHub.

With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and
continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository.

Workflows run in Linux, macOS, Windows, and containers on GitHub-hosted
machines, called **runners**. Alternatively, you can also host your own runners
to run workflows on machines you own or manage.

You can create workflows using actions defined in your repository, open source
actions in a public repository on GitHub, or a published Docker container image.
Workflows in forked repositories don't run by default.

You can discover actions to use in your workflow on GitHub and build actions to
share with the GitHub community. Discovering actions in the [GitHub community
GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) is a central
location for you to find, share, and use actions built by t

## Límites de uso

There are some limits on GitHub Actions usage, and will vary depending on
whether you use GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners. Here we only consider
the limitations for GutHub Hosted.

- **Job execution time:** A job in a workflow can run for up 
  to **6 hours** of execution time.

- **Workflow run time**: The workflow run is limited to **72 hours**. 

- **API requests**: You can execute up to **1000 API requests in an hour**
  across all actions **within a repository**.

- **Concurrent jobs**: The number of concurrent jobs you can run in your account
depends on your GitHub plan, as indicated in the following table.

| GitHub plan | Total concurrent jobs | Maximum concurrent macOS jobs |
|-------------:----------------------:|------------------------------:|
| Free        |                    20 |	                            5 |
| Pro	      |                    40 |                             5 |
| Team	      |                    60 |                             5 |
| Enterprise  |                   180 |                            50 |

- **Job matrix**: A job matrix can generate a maximum of **256 jobs per 
  workflow run**.
